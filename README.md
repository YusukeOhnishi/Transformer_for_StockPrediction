## Usage
### Overview
By using the created model, you can predict stock prices.Stock price information is searched based on the stock and period conditions specified on the application, and the Transformer model is retrained based on the results.

The weights of the initial Transformer model are the result of training using stock prices of stocks listed on the TSE Prime Market up to the present (November 3, 2023).
The list of stocks specifically used is as follows: ```./data/Stock_List.csv```.
### Set the Parameter
You need to enter the stock code, stock price acquisition start date, and acquisition end date.
